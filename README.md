#  AirBnB clone - The console



This team project is part of the Holberton School Full-Stack Software Engineer program. It's the first step towards building a first full web application: an AirBnB clone. 

IT consists of a custom command-line interface for data management, and the base classes for the storage of this data.

This repository contains the initial stage of the above mentioned project. This stage implements a backend interface, or console, to manage program data. Console commands allow the user to create, update, and destroy objects, as well as manage file storage. Using a system of JSON serialization/deserialization, storage is persistent between sessions.


## Function

The console works both in interactive mode and non-interactive mode, much like a Unix shell. It prints a prompt **(hbnb)** and waits for the user for input.

| Action | Command |
|--------------|------|
| Run the console |```./console.py```|
| Quit the console | ```(hbnb) quit``` |
| Display the help for a command | ```(hbnb) help <command>``` |
| Create an object (prints its id)|```(hbnb) create <class>``` |
| Show an object | `(hbnb) show <class> <id>` or `(hbnb) <class>.show(<id>)` |
| Destroy an object | `(hbnb) destroy <class> <id>` or `(hbnb) <class>.destroy(<id>)` |
| Show all objects, or all instances of a class | `(hbnb) all` or `(hbnb) all <class>` |
| Update an attribute of an object | `(hbnb) update <class> <id> <attribute name> "<attribute value>"` or `(hbnb) <class>.update(<id>, <attribute name>, "<attribute value>")` |
___________________________________________________________________

Non-interactive mode example:

```$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  all  count  create  destroy  help  quit  show update
```

## File storage

The folder  **engine** manages the serialization and deserialization of all the data, following a JSON format.

A FileStorage class is defined in  **file_storage.py**  with methods to follow this flow:  `<object> -> to_dict() -> <dictionary> -> JSON dump -> <json string> -> FILE -> <json string> -> JSON load -> <dictionary> -> <object>`

The  **_init_.py** file contains the instantiation of the FileStorage class called  **storage**, followed by a call to the method reload() on that instance. This allows the storage to be reloaded automatically at initialization, which recovers the serialized data.

## 

All your files and folders are presented as a tree in the file explorer. You can switch from one to another by clicking a file in the tree.

## Usage
1.  First clone this repository.
    
2.  Once the repository is cloned locate the "console.py" file and run it as follows:
    

```
/AirBnB_clone$ ./console.py

```

4.  When this command is run the following prompt should appear:

```
(hbnb)

```

5.  This prompt means you are in the "HBnB" console. There are a variety of commands available within the console program.

##### Commands

```
* create - Creates an instance based on given class

* destroy - Destroys an object based on class and UUID

* show - Shows an object based on class and UUID

* all - Shows all objects the program has access to, or all objects of a given class

* update - Updates existing attributes an object based on class name and UUID

* quit - Exits the program (EOF will as well)

```

***Alternative Syntax***

Users are able to issue a number of console command using an alternative syntax:

```
Usage: <class_name>.<command>([<id>[name_arg value_arg]|[kwargs]])

```



## Examples

### Primary Command Syntax ###

***Example 0: Create an object***

Usage: **create <class_name>**



***Example 1: Show an object***

Usage: **show <class_name> <_id>**



***Example 2: Destroy an object***

Usage: **destroy <class_name> <_id>**


***Example 3: Update an object***

Usage: **update <class_name> <_id>**


***Alternative Syntax***

***Example 0: Show all User objects***

Usage: **<class_name>.all()**


***Example 1: Destroy a User***

Usage: **<class_name>.destroy(<_id>)**


***Example 2: Update User (by attribute)***

Usage: **<class_name>.update(<_id>, <attribute_name>, <attribute_value>)**


***Example 3: Update User (by dictionary)***

Usage: **<class_name>.update(<_id>)**


## Tests

All the code is tested with the  **unittest**  module. The test for the classes are in the **test_models** folder.
